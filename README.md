This repo provides files used to create an audio application using the JUCE framework. Using JUCE's FFT class, spectral information was displayed on a Novation Launchpad using MIDI messages to light up tiles. The files in each folder showcase the UI and underlying functionality of the application, however all of the background JUCE code is not included.
